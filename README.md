# VisualizaingEquivalenceClasses
The project supplements the RapClust pipeline in a way to visualize fragmented equivalence classes using a web GUI interface. It includes incorporating optimizations to process hundred thousands of nodes and display it using multi-level clustering.


Main Project Folders/File Descriptions:
	- ./
		Contains entire codebase related to admin panel along with other resources

			* Gruntfile.js : Build file containing code to serve the webpages, create dist, clean old dist, livereload dev environment changes etc.

			* dist : Contains the entire panel code compiled, minified, uglified, cdnified and aggregated for deployment purposes (like on Amazon EC2 or EBS along with CDN compatibility for all resources such as images, fonts, scripts etc.)

			* app/index.html : Main HTML page for our angular application containing global HTML code snippets

			* app/scripts/app.js : Angular application init module

			* app/scripts/config.js : generic global information store

			* app/scripts/controllers : contain scripts for various controllers in our single page web application

			* app/scripts/directives : generic global code snippets/functions/modules which are to be used like libraries in HTML/JS code of application

			* app/scripts/libs : contain scripts for various basic graphing libraries

			* app/styles/main.scss : entire CSS style design in this file except fonts

			* app/styles/fonts.scss : fonts CSS style design in this file

			* app/views/*.html : contain HTML code for various controllers in our single page web application

	- ./server
		Contains server code as well as database file "db.json"

			* server.js : Node.js server code using "json-server" for RESTful routes and "lowdb" for database purposes along with all complex computations for generating clusters and other useful data (line 237 - default edge weight threshold is 0.5; can be modified for allowing more/less edges)

			* db.json : Database file

			* resources/eq_classes.txt : This is the main file containing the equivalence classes result generated by RapClust, which is used by our server to construct the final view

	- ./README
		The file that you are reading right now

Steps to Setup:
	- ./
		* Developer mode
			# Run the sequence of commands in the given sequence in successive steps (assumption - node and npm are installed)
			# `npm install -g grunt-cli bower`
			# `gem install compass` (assumption - ruby is installed and functioning properly)
			# `npm install`
			# `bower install`
			# `grunt serve` (this is to initiate the web application and serve it in developer mode automatically)
			# open browser and go to "0.0.0.0:9000" or "localhost:9000"

			# `grunt clean build` (this is to generate dist folder for normal mode)

		*Normal mode
			# `cd dist` (assumption - dist is already generated)
			# `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` (assumption - python is installed; Mac OS X and Linux)
			# `python -m http.server` (assumption - python is installed; Windows)
			# open browser and go to "0.0.0.0:8000" or "localhost:8000"

	- ./server/mcl
		* Developer/Normal mode
			# `cd server`
			# `tar xzf mcl-latest.tar.gz`
			# `cd mcl-14-137`
			# `./configure --prefix=$HOME/local`
			# `make install`
			# `export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/local/bin`

	- ./server
		* Developer/Normal mode
			# `cd server`
			# `npm install`
			# `npm start` (to start the backend server)
